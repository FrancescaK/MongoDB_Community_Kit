##Contributing to the Docs

Contributing to the docs is simple. Tens of thousands of people view these docs each day so itâ€™s a great way to have an impact immediately.

The entire documentation source for our manual is available in the [mongodb/docs repository](https://github.com/mongodb/docs), which is one of the [MongoDB project repositories on GitHub](http://github.com/mongodb).
To contribute to the documentation, you can open a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), fork the [mongodb/docs repository](https://github.com/mongodb/docs), make a change, and issue a pull request.
In order for the documentation team to accept your change, you must complete the [MongoDB Contributor Agreement](http://www.10gen.com/legal/contributor-agreement).
You can clone the repository by issuing the following command at your system shell:
```git clone git://github.com/mongodb/docs.git```
