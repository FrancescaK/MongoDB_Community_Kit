Hello and welcome to the MongoDB Community Kit. 

As a MongoDB user, you have the opportunity to make a large impact on a vibrant community of open source developers 
and engineering professionals. You can:

* Give a talk on how you've used MongoDB at your company, and what you've learned in the process.
* Write a blog post with practical advice on how to use MongoDB in production (get featured on [planet.mongodb.org](http://planet.mongodb.org)!)
* Create open source tools, frameworks, or drivers for MongoDB that enable new uses for MongoDB.
* Create a local User Group that engages community members and advocates 

These are just a few of the ways you can make an impact in the community and develop your knowledge, skills, and experience. 
This kit is meant to help you get started and introduce you to the techniques that have worked for others. 
Once you are comfortable with the kit, we encourage you to give feedback and offer your advice. Just fork 
this repo and submit a pull request to add to or adjust the content.

We look forward to supporting you along the way.

Best of luck,

The MongoDB Community Team
