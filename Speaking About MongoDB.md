#Speaking about MongoDB

##Why Should You Speak?

###What’s in it for you?

* Personal Name Recognition: Get your name out there with MongoDB enthusiasts
* Association with a great product gives you credibility
* Boost your speaking abilities and practice presenting
* Polish your knowledge of MongoDB - speaking forces  evangelists to deepen and tweak their knowledge of the database
* Spread the word about a program that has changed and enhanced your career
* Showcase your company - speaking on specific use cases can be an easy way to promote your own organization
* Recruit candidates with MongoDB interest or skills

###What's in it for your audience?

* Presentations have direct impact on both individual users and the larger community
* Audience members want to learn from you and from your experience
* Use cases and experience help people avoid similar errors
* Every presentation given grows the collective knowledge base about MongoDB
* You help create a community around MongoDB

###What Should You Talk About?
Teach them something! MongoDB User Group members have different levels of experience with MongoDB, but everyone wants to learn more. Talk about topics you are comfortable with --- as technical or as conceptual as that may be.

Some great topics include:

1. MongoDB in the Cloud (AWS, Rackspace, SoftLayer, etc.)
2. Monitoring Your MongoDB Deployment
3. Scaling MongoDB
4. "Things I wish I knew About MongoDB When I Started"
5. How I use MongoDB in Production
    * [Using MongoDB for Groupon's Place Data](http://www.mongodb.com/presentations/using-mongodb-groupons-place-data)
    * [Storing eBay's Media Metadata on MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com/presentations/storing-ebays-media-metadata-mongodb-0)
    * [Real World Application Performance with MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com/presentations/real-world-application-performance-mongodb)
6. How to use MongoDB in a Specific Language
    * MongoDB and PHP
    * MongoDB and Ruby
    * MongoDB and Java
    * etc.
7. MongoDB and Big Data
    * SQL, NoSQL and Big Data Architecture
    * HIVE, Hadoop, and other MongoDB integrations


### Top ten tips for creating awesome Slide Decks

1. **Know your audience**: If you're presenting at a meetup or event, you should ideally attend at least one prior event so you have an idea of typical attendees and the level of technical detail expected. The event organizer should also be able to give you some guidance on the level of MongoDB experience and what the audience might be particularly interested in.

* **Know your venue**: Ask about the room/venue where you will be presenting so you can match your slide deck to the environment. Consider the room size and available A/V options (projector, TV, sound, ...) and for projectors/TVs ask about the native resolution (i.e. 1280x720) and available connectors (HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA).

* **Be concise**: Avoid including full text such as sentences and paragraphs in your slides, and try to minimize the number of slides included. The audience is there to hear you share your experience, not to read your slides.

* **Be visual**: A clever picture, easy to read chart, or even simple bullet points can convey clear information. Visuals are often more effective than code examples, and can also be useful if you want to adapt the level of detail in your talk delivery based on the audience.

* **Use big fonts**: Some meeting rooms are large and text may be hard to see from the back of the room.

* **Check for contrast**: Depending on the brightness of the room and the A/V equipment, some colour combinations may look great on a laptop screen but be difficult for the audience to read on a projector.

* **Focus code samples**: As a rule of thumb, keep code samples between 8-10 lines for simple readability. Highlight the important lines. 

* **Check your spelling & grammar**: Attention to detail is important, particularly for technical audiences. Obvious spelling and grammar errors can be distracting and some audience members may feel compelled to point these out.

* **Rehearse! Rehearse! Rehearse!**: Practice running through your slide deck and consider how well your talk flows from one slide to the next. You may find that some slides are unnecessary or hard to explain without further details. It's very helpful to get an idea of the timing for your talk so you aren't trying to fit 40 minutes of slides into a 25 minute session (or vice-versa).

* **Consider speaker notes**: Many user group organizers make slides available online after the user group. Consider adding speaker notes with some extra context to explain slides for viewers who don't have the benefit of your accompanying talk.

##Where Can You Speak About MongoDB?

Presentations reach thousands of users around the world. Here are some places to share your knowledge:

* External Conferences: Find conferences accepting talk proposals.
* [MongoDB User Groups (MUGs)](http://www.mongodb.com/user-groups): A more informal place to practice your presentation and meet great people.
* [MongoDB Days](http://www.mongodb.com/events): Full day events for more advanced and more technical presentations.
* Lightning Talks and Demos: Offer to give a 5-10 minute presentation on a MongoDB tool to build up your presentation skills.

####Things to Remember Before You Speak at the Event:

* Ask the organizer what time you should arrive (also be courteous and arrive on time).
* Make sure your computer or presentation will be compatible with the presentation setup available at the event. Ask the organizer to make sure you have the correct connecting equipment. If you need a different adapter for your laptop, please try to bring it with you.
* Carry your presentations on a USB drive --- just in case.
* Send your presentations to the organizer so they can distribute it with the group. It's great to share this information.
* Internet connectivity: wifi can be unreliable in some places. To avoid any painful situations with wifi, try to make any demos in your presentations available offline.
* Invite your friends! It's always fun to bring along friends, family, and coworkers to a user group -- but be sure to check with the organizer to ensure the meeting location has enough capacity.
