At Your Company
================================

If you believe MongoDB can benefit others at your company or organization, there are a number of ways you can introduce your colleagues
to this new technology. 

###Host a Hackathon

Hackathons are a great way to expose developers in your company to MongoDB and show managers what MongoDB can do. Try holding a hackathon for building a MongoDB app. Below are some best practices for planning a hackathon:

* Set goals that benefit everyone - education, collaboration, and development
* Create a scope and establish evaluation criteria
* Plan event logistics
    * Venue
    * Food
    * Audio/Visual
* Provide resources and support for your participants
* Demo apps
* Invite high-profile judges and create special awards
* Showcase apps afterwards to your company
* Blog about the hackathon and provide links to live apps afterwards

Let us know if youâ€™d like help!

###Host a Meetup

If you don't want to or can't commit the resources to a hackathon, host a local meetup at your company. This is a great way to introduce MongoDB to any interested co-workers, and you can gain speaking experience sharing how you're using MongoDB on a project.

####Attend a local MongoDB User Group

Bring your boss to a local MongoDB User Group. This will help them see the technology in action and see the ecosystem around the database.

For a list of user groups see [the user group page on MongoDB.com](http://www.mongodb.com/user-groups)

####Attend a MongoDB Event

Encourage colleagues to attend a MongoDB Event with you. Discussing what you've learned with co-workers will enforce your new knowledge as well as allow you to share it with others back at the office.
