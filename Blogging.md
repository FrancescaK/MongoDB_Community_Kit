###Spread the word
Once you've written your post, you need to build an audience. There are many ways to get people to read and engage with your blog. As you start building an audience, remember that quality is as important as quantity. Your early readers are critical. When your audience comments, respond and thank them for their feedback!  And remember, if someone leaves a negative comment, stay as respectful, positive, and productive as possible in your response.

###Where you can post

_Your personal blog_ It's never been easier to create a blog. There are platforms like Wordpress, Tumblr, Jekyl and Octopress that make it dead simple to get your content out there. You can also post to Medium.

_Guest post on the MongoDB Blog_: We are happy to have guests posts on the MongoDB community blog. Just follow the guidelines above, and make sure the posts are technical in nature. Send a copy of a blog post or an abstract in a markdown format to the [MongoDB community team](mailto:meetups@mongodb.com). We’ll have a look to see if it is a good fit.

_Social Media_: Social media is an obvious and extremely effective channel for getting the word out about your content. Use Twitter to identify relevant hashtags and tweet out your article. Make sure to follow your stream for any responses or feedback. Post an update on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google+ to broaden your reach.

###Planet MongoDB

[Planet MongoDB](http://planet.mongodb.org/) is an aggregator of MongoDB news. It's the go-to place for the latest MongoDB content. The MongoDB community team manages the bloggers that get added to Planet MongoDB.

How do we select who gets added? Like many open source communities with a blog aggregator, we have two simple criteria:

* You write posts about MongoDB that are valuable to the community. Planet MongoDB is for sharing of knowledge, news, and best practices around the MongoDB community and its members. It's not for product pitches.
* Your writing reflects your respect for others in the community. Thou shalt not troll.

Want to get added? It's easy. [Get in touch](mailto:meetups@mongodb.com) with the following information:

* Name
* Blog
* RSS (if you blog about non-MongoDB topics, send a mongodb-specific category feed)
* Why should you be on Planet MongoDB
