Hello and welcome to the MongoDB Developer Advocacy Kit. This kit is designed to give guidance to those interested in 
participating in the MongoDB community. Included are best practices meant to help you, as a user and community member, 
assist yourself and others in achieving success in our growing open-source community. This kit is based on the work 
done and questions asked by MongoDB community members. 

As a MongoDB user, you have the opportunity to make a large impact on a vibrant community of open source developers 
and engineering professionals. You can:

* Give a talk on how you've used MongoDB at your company, and what you've learned in the process.
* Write a blog post with practical advice on how to use MongoDB in production (get featured on [planet.mongodb.org](http://planet.mongodb.org)!)
* Create open source tools, frameworks, or drivers for MongoDB that enable your fellow developers.
* Create a local User Group that engages community members and advocates for the use of MongoDB by local engineers and companies.

There are hundreds of ways for you to make an impact and develop your knowledge, skills, and experience. 
This guide is meant to help you get started and introduce you to the techniques that have worked for others. 
Once you are comfortable with the guide, we encourage you to give feedback and offer your advice. Just fork 
this repo and submit a pull request to add to or adjust the content.

We look forward to supporting you along the way.

Best of luck,

The MongoDB Community Team
