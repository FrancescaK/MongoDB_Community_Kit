Contributing Code
===========================================

Open source is driven by community contribution, and one of the most effective ways to participate is by contributing code.

Guidelines for Contributing:

* Take a look at what’s there: Before starting to write code, look for existing [tickets](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/) or [create one](https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa) for your bug, issue, or feature request.
* Avoid breaking backward compatibility.
* Write inline documentation so others can understand your code.
* Write tests and make sure they pass before submitting a pull request.
* Review the license. To contribute to the MongoDB Server, you must sign the [contributor agreement](http://www.mongodb.com/legal/contributor-agreement).
* Add yourself to the contributors list.
* Read the guidelines for contributing to existing projects. This can be found on each individual project page. Also see the [list of driver projects](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/).
* [Request a contributor t-shirt](http://www.mongodb.com/swag) once you’ve your first patch is accepted.

If you need help or advice, the [MongoDB-user](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mongodb-user) and [MongoDB-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mongodb-dev) mailing lists are extremely active, and a good place to ask questions or to learn by watching. MongoDB-user is for users building applications with MongoDB. MongoDB-Dev is best used by those contributing to the database or building third party tools.

Always remember: MongoDB is developed in the open. The source code can be the best way to understand how it works.
