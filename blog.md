Blogging
=============================

_Guest post on the MongoDB Blog_: We are happy to have guests posts on the MongoDB community blog. Just follow the guidelines above, and make sure the posts are technical in nature. Send a copy of a blog post or an abstract in a markdown format to the [MongoDB community team](mailto:meetups@mongodb.com). We’ll have a look to see if it is a good fit!

###Spread the word

Once you've written your post, you need to build an audience. There are many ways to get people to read and engage with your blog. As you start building an audience, remember that quality is as important as quantity. Your early readers are critical. When your audience comments, respond and thank them for their feedback!  And remember, if someone leaves a negative comment, stay respectful and mature in your response.

_Social Media_: Social media is an obvious and extremely effective channel for getting the word out about your content. Using Twitter, identify relevant hashtags and tweet out your article. Make sure to follow your stream for any responses or feedback. Post an update on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google+ to broaden your reach. You can also consider posting in relevant LinkedIn or Facebook groups to get further feedback.

_Hacker News_: Getting onto the front page of Hacker News will definitely bring traffic to your blog. You should be ready to respond to commentary on Hacker News should you get upvoted!

_Reddit_: For MongoDB articles, there is an [active subreddit] (http://www.reddit.com/r/mongodb) where you can post interesting articles about MongoDB. Link to your reddit post on Twitter, and keep an eye out for comments and responses. In addition to the MongoDB subreddit, you should cross post to other relevant subreddits as appropriate, such as r/programming or r/python, etc.

_MongoDB Community_: If you're looking for publicity from the official MongoDB channels, get in touch with the MongoDB community team! We can help you get your article tweeted out from @mongodb and posted in other official social media channels. We may also have other suggestions for getting the word out.

_Local UGs_: Are you a member of a local MongoDB or programming language meetup? Many of those groups have active mailing lists or user forums, which are great places to post links to your blog.

_Newsletters_: Getting listed in a newsletter is another way to expand reach for your blog post. Some examples of interesting technical newsletters include [DevOps Weekly](http://devopsweekly.com/), [Python Weekly](http://www.pythonweekly.com/), and [NoSQL Weekly](http://www.nosqlweekly.com/). If you’re interested in getting featured in the MongoDB newsletter, [contact the MongoDB community team](mailto:meetups@10gen.com).

###Planet MongoDB

[Planet MongoDB](http://planet.mongodb.org/) is an aggregator of MongoDB news. It's the go-to place for the latest MongoDB content. The MongoDB community team manages the bloggers that get added to Planet MongoDB.

How do we select who gets added? Like many open source communities with a blog aggregator, we have two simple criteria:

* You write posts about MongoDB that are valuable to the community. Planet MongoDB is for sharing of knowledge, news, and best practices around the MongoDB community and its members. It's not for product pitches.
* Your writing reflects your respect for others in the community. Thou shalt not troll.

Want to get added? It's easy. [Get in touch](mailto:meetups@mongodb.com) with the following information:

* Name
* Blog
* RSS (if you blog about non-MongoDB topics, send a mongodb-specific category feed)
* Why should you be on Planet MongoDB
