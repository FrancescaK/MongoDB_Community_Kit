Hello and welcome to the MongoDB Developer Advocacy Kit. This kit is designed to give guidance to those interested in participating in the MongoDB community. These directives are meant to help you, as a user and community member, help other users become successful in a growing open source community.

As a MongoDB user, you have the opportunity to make a large impact on a vibrant community of open source developers and engineering professionals. Your knowledge, experience, and skills can have a tremendous impact on future users. Here are some ways community members can provide valuable impact:

* Give a talk on how you've used MongoDB at your company and the lessons you've learned
* Write a blog post with real advice on how to use MongoDB in production (get featured on planet.mongodb.com!)
* Create open source tools, frameworks, or drivers for MongoDB that enable your fellow developers
* Create a local User Group that engages and advocates for the use of MongoDB at local companies and projects

There are hundreds of ways for you to make an impact. This guide is meant to help you get started and introduce you to the practices that have worked for others. Once you have started using it, we encourage you to give feedback and offer your advice. Just submit a pull request on a page to add or adjust the content.

We look forward to supporting you along the way.

Best of luck,

The MongoDB Community Team
