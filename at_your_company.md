At Your Company

###Host a Hackathon

Hackathons are a great way to expose developers in your company to MongoDB and show managers what MongoDB can do. Try holding a hackathon for building a MongoDB app. Below are some best practices for planning a hackathon:
 
* Set goals that benefit everyone - education, collaboration, and development
* Create a scope and establish evaluation criteria
* Plan event logistics
** Venue
** Food
** Audio/Visual
* Provide resources and support for your participants
* Demo apps
* Invite high-profile judges and create special awards
* Showcase apps afterwards to your company
