Top 5 Tips on creating awesome Slide Decks:

* Be precise - Most user group organizers make slides available online after the user group, so make sure they are correct and to the point.
* Be visual - a clever picture, easy to read chart, or even simple bullet points convey clear information.
* Use Big Font! Some meeting rooms are large and it is always hard to see from the back of the room
* Avoid including full text such as sentences and paragraphs in your slides. This makes it difficult for people to pay attention to your thoughts and expertise.
* Know your audience -The audience is generally knowledgeable about MongoDB and related technologies. They are interested in hearing your insights and experience so they can become better MongoDB developers.

####Things to Remember Before you speak at the Event:

* Ask the organizer what time you should arrive (also be courteous and arrive on time)
* Make sure your computer or presentation will be compatible with the presentation setup available at the meetup group. Ask the organizer to make sure you have the correct connecting equipment. If you need a different adaptor for your laptop, please try to bring it with you.
* Carry your presentation on a USB- just in case.
* Send your presentations to the organizer so they can distribute it with the group. It's great to share this information
* Internet connectivity: wifi can be tedious in some places. To avoid any painful situations with wifi, try to make any demos in your presentations available offline.
