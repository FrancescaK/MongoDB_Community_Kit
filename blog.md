Blogging
=============================

###Why should you blog?

Blogging is a great way to share your experiences. Blogging often and knowledgeably on a topic establishes you as a authority, as well as giving your thoughts a broad audience and making your insight available to readers for years.

###Writing a great technical post

_Have a thesis_: Just like essays from your high school and college days, great blog posts have a clear message. When you begin writing your post, start by forming a key message or statement. Ask yourself, what do I want the reader to take away from this post? A good article will typically leave readers with a key statement. Everything else in your post is supporting evidence.

_Include code samples_: The best technical posts will most likely include examples, in code, of the thesis that you are trying to illustrate. These examples, and by extension the concepts they illustrate, should be reproducible by readers of your post.

_Create diagrams_: Images can help illustrate your point and do a nice job of breaking up text. Particularly for posts covering complex architectural concepts, diagrams can be powerful tools. However, don't feel obligated to include slick graphics if they will be unhelpful or distracting.

_Show Data_: You can't make your point without the facts! Consider including statistics, performance data, and other metrics in your post. Visualizations like graphs and charts can be compelling while providing visual interest.

_Include sections_: Readers digest content in chunks. By breaking your post into sections, it will be easier for you to write and easier for your readers to consume. Leave a post for a few days before publishing and come back to it to check for readability.

_Keep it short_: Blog posts don’t need to be long. In fact, I would urge you to try and keep posts concise (between 250 and 500 words). If the topic is especially broad then be sure to either break it up into multiple posts, or break the post up into logical sections to help readers digest the content.

_Build series_: Blog series are a great way to build momentum on your blog. They publicly commit you to a series of topics as well as building readers' interest.

###How to generate ideas

Sometimes it can be hard to know where to start when it comes to blogging. Sometimes we think that our day-to-day can't possibly be publishable! Yet our experiences, especially when it comes to open source, can be incredibly valuable when shared, and sometimes what may seem like a mundane task to you is actually an opportunity for enlightenment to a new MongoDB user.

Here are some ways to generate new ideas for MongoDB blogging content:

* Describe a problem that you recently solved and the way you solved it.
* Explain how you designed your MongoDB application and the trade-offs that you made.
* What do you wish you knew when you were first starting out? Write a blog post that addresses that topic.
* How has your application evolved over time? How has it grown and scaled?
* Many people are migrating applications from relational databases, or living in a hybrid world. What are the common migration and mixed-use patterns?
* What are the open source tools and libraries that you rely on?
* Have you written an open source tool that you want to show off? A blog is a great way to get users and contributors.
* Write a "How To" on MongoDB with a specific language, framework, or open source tool.
* Turn conference or meetup presentations into blog posts or post your slides to your blog with short summaries.

###Where you can post

_Your personal blog_: It's never been easier to create a blog. There are platforms like Wordpress, Tumblr, Jekyl and Octopress that make it dead simple to get your content out there. You can also post to Medium.

_Your company blog_: Many great companies have engineering blogs where they publish articles about the underlying technologies powering their business (see [foursquare](http://engineering.foursquare.com/) and [Server Density](https://blog.serverdensity.com/)). These blogs are a great way to get more exposure for your company in the developer community.

_Guest post on the MongoDB Blog_: We are happy to have guests posts on the MongoDB community blog. Just follow the guidelines above, and make sure the posts are technical in nature. Send a copy of a blog post or an abstract in a markdown format to the [MongoDB community team](mailto:meetups@mongodb.com). We’ll have a look to see if it is a good fit!

###Spread the word

Once you've written your post, you need to build an audience. There are many ways to get people to read and engage with your blog. As you start building an audience, remember that quality is as important as quantity. Your early readers are critical. When your audience comments, respond and thank them for their feedback!  And remember, if someone leaves a negative comment, stay respectful and mature in your response.

_Social Media_: Social media is an obvious and extremely effective channel for getting the word out about your content. Using Twitter, identify relevant hashtags and tweet out your article. Make sure to follow your stream for any responses or feedback. Post an update on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google+ to broaden your reach. You can also consider posting in relevant LinkedIn or Facebook groups to get further feedback.

_Hacker News_: Getting onto the front page of Hacker News will definitely bring traffic to your blog. You should be ready to respond to commentary on Hacker News should you get upvoted!

_Reddit_: For MongoDB articles, there is an [active subreddit] (http://www.reddit.com/r/mongodb) where you can post interesting articles about MongoDB. Link to your reddit post on Twitter, and keep an eye out for comments and responses. In addition to the MongoDB subreddit, you should cross post to other relevant subreddits as appropriate, such as r/programming or r/python, etc.

_MongoDB Community_: If you're looking for publicity from the official MongoDB channels, get in touch with the MongoDB community team! We can help you get your article tweeted out from @mongodb and posted in other official social media channels. We may also have other suggestions for getting the word out.

_Local UGs_: Are you a member of a local MongoDB or programming language meetup? Many of those groups have active mailing lists or user forums, which are great places to post links to your blog.

_Newsletters_: Getting listed in a newsletter is another way to expand reach for your blog post. Some examples of interesting technical newsletters include [DevOps Weekly](http://devopsweekly.com/), [Python Weekly](http://www.pythonweekly.com/), and [NoSQL Weekly](http://www.nosqlweekly.com/). If you’re interested in getting featured in the MongoDB newsletter, [contact the MongoDB community team](mailto:meetups@10gen.com).

###Planet MongoDB

[Planet MongoDB](http://planet.mongodb.org/) is an aggregator of MongoDB news. It's the go-to place for the latest MongoDB content. The MongoDB community team manages the bloggers that get added to Planet MongoDB.
