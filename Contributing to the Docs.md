##Contributing to the Docs

Contributing to the docs is simple, but has a large payoff. Tens of thousands of people view these docs each day so it's a great way to have an impact immediately.

The entire documentation source for our manual is available in the [mongodb/docs repository](https://github.com/mongodb/docs), which is one of the many [MongoDB project repositories on GitHub](http://github.com/mongodb).
To contribute to the documentation, you can just fork the [mongodb/docs repository](https://github.com/mongodb/docs), make a change, and issue a pull request.
In order for the documentation team to accept your change, you must complete the [MongoDB Contributor Agreement](http://www.mongodb.com/legal/contributor-agreement).

For more information on the MongoDB documentation process, see:

* [MongoDB Documentation Style and Conventions](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/meta/style-guide/)
* [MongoDB Documentation Practices and Processes](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/meta/practices/)
* [MongoDB Documentation Organization](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/meta/organization/)
* [Build and Deploy the MongoDB Documentation](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/meta/build/)

If you have any questions about the Docs, please feel free to [open a Jira Case in the DOCS project](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DOCS).
