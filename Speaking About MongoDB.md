Top 5 Tips on creating awesome Slide Decks:

* Be precise: Most user group organizers make slides available online after the user group, so make sure they are correct and to the point.
* Be visual: a clever picture, easy to read chart, or even simple bullet points convey clear information. This is often more effective than code examples.
* Use big fonts! Some meeting rooms are large and it is always hard to see from the back of the room.
* Avoid including full text such as sentences and paragraphs in your slides. This makes it difficult for people to pay 
attention to your thoughts and expertise.
* Code samples: As a rule of thumb, keep code samples between 8-10 lines for simple readability. Highlight the important lines. 
* Know your audience - The audience is generally knowledgeable about MongoDB and related technologies. They are interested in hearing your insights and experience so they can become better MongoDB developers.

##Where Can You Speak About MongoDB?

Presentations reach thousands of users around the world. Here are some places to share your knowledge:

* External Conferences: Find conferences accepting talk proposals.
* [MongoDB User Groups (MUGs)](http://www.mongodb.com/user-groups): A more informal place to practice your presentation and meet great people.
* [MongoDB Days](http://www.mongodb.com/events): Full day events for more advanced and more technical presentations.
* Lightning Talks and Demos: Offer to give a 5-10 minute presentation on a MongoDB tool to build up your presentation skills.

####Things to Remember Before You Speak at the Event:

* Ask the organizer what time you should arrive (also be courteous and arrive on time).
* Make sure your computer or presentation will be compatible with the presentation setup available at the event. Ask the organizer to make sure you have the correct connecting equipment. If you need a different adapter for your laptop, please try to bring it with you.
* Carry your presentations on a USB drive --- just in case.
* Send your presentations to the organizer so they can distribute it with the group. It's great to share this information.
* Internet connectivity: wifi can be unreliable in some places. To avoid any painful situations with wifi, try to make any demos in your presentations available offline.
* Invite your friends! It's always fun to bring along friends, family, and coworkers to a user group -- but be sure to check with the organizer to ensure the meeting location has enough capacity.
