Blogging
=============================

Blogging is an awesome way to share your knowledge and experiences with others. If you're blogging about MongoDB, MongoDB's community team 
can help you gain exposure for your content, so you can share your knowledge and experience with other users. For more tips on Blogging Check out
the [Blogging Best Practices](https://github.com/FrancescaK/MongoDB_DAK/blob/master/blogging_best_practices.md) section.

###Where you can post

_Your personal blog_ It's never been easier to create a blog. There are platforms like Wordpress, Tumblr, Jekyl and Octopress that make it dead simple to get your content out there. You can also post to Medium.

_Your company blog_ Many great companies have engineering blogs where they publish articles about the underlying technologies powering their business (see [foursquare](http://engineering.foursquare.com/) and [Server Density](https://blog.serverdensity.com/)). These blogs are a great way to get more exposure for your company in the developer community.

_Guest post on the MongoDB Blog_ We are happy to have guests posts on the MongoDB community blog. Just follow the guidelines above, and make sure the posts are technical in nature. Send a copy of a blog post or an abstract in a markdown format to the [MongoDB community team](mailto:meetups@mongodb.com). Weâ€™ll have a look to see if it is a good fit!


###Sharing Your Content 

There are a number of different social channels you can use to share your content listed in our [Blogging Best Practices section](https://github.com/FrancescaK/MongoDB_DAK/blob/master/blogging_best_practices.md#spread-the-word)

###Planet MongoDB

[Planet MongoDB](http://planet.mongodb.org/) is an aggregator of MongoDB news. It's the go-to place for the latest MongoDB content. The MongoDB community team manages the bloggers that get added to Planet MongoDB.

How do we select who gets added? Like many open source communities with a blog aggregator, we have two simple criteria:

* You write posts about MongoDB that are valuable to the community. Planet MongoDB is for sharing of knowledge, news, and best practices around the MongoDB community and its members. It's not for product pitches.
* Your writing reflects your respect for others in the community. Thou shalt not troll.

Want to get added? It's easy. [Get in touch](mailto:meetups@mongodb.com) with the following information:

* Name
* Blog
* RSS (if you blog about non-MongoDB topics, send a mongodb-specific category feed)
* Why should you be on Planet MongoDB
