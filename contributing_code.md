Contributing Code
===========================================

Open source software is driven by community contribution, and one of the most effective ways to participate is by contributing code to either the [MongoDB Server Repo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) or one of the many related projects.

Guidelines for Contributing:

* Take a look at whatâ€™s there. Before starting to write code, look for existing [tickets](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/) or [create one](https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa) for your bug, improvement, or feature request.
* Avoid breaking backward compatibility.
* Write inline documentation (comments) so others can understand your code.
* Write tests and make sure they pass.
* Make sure your code does not break any of the existing tests.
* Review the appropriate project license. To contribute to the MongoDB Server, you must sign the [contributor agreement](http://www.mongodb.com/legal/contributor-agreement).
* Add yourself to the contributors list. Most projects have a [list of contributors](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-hadoop#contributors)
on their Github READMe. Once your patch as been accepted, add yourself to the list. 
* Read the guidelines for contributing to existing projects. This can be found on each individual project page. Also see the [list of driver projects](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/).
* Show off your accomplishment by [requesting a contributor t-shirt](http://www.mongodb.com/swag) once your first patch has landed.

If you need help or advice, the [MongoDB-user](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mongodb-user) and [MongoDB-Dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mongodb-dev) mailing lists are extremely active, and are both good places to either ask questions or learn from others' experiences. MongoDB-user is for users building applications with MongoDB, whereas MongoDB-Dev is best used by those contributing to the database or building third party tools. Also be sure to check out the #mongodb IRC channel on Freenode, or tag your question with mongodb (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mongodb) on Stack Overflow.

Always remember: MongoDB is developed in the open. The source code can often be the best way to understand how it works.
